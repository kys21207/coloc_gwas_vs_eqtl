## Useful eQTL resources
1. The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) Study <br>
   eQTL data - DLPFC snRNAseq: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn52335807 <br>
ROS is a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) <br>
Single Cell RNAseq - Microglia <br>
The isolation of microglia was performed as described in A transcriptomic atlas of aged human microglia and A single cell-based atlas of human microglial states reveals associations with neurological disorders and histopathological features of the aging brain. <br>
2. https://onek1k.org/ <br>
The OneK1K cohort consists of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1.27 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) collected from 982 donors. We developed a framework for the classification of individual cells, and by combining the scRNA-seq data with genotype data, we mapped the genetic effects on gene expression in each of 14 immune cell types and identified 26,597 independent cisâ€“expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). <br>
